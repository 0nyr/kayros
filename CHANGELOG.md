# Changelog

All notable changes to KAYROS are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Certificate semantics and benchmark provenance are documented in `README.md` and `cpp/lera/NOTICE.md`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-15

The theme of this release is **sound, audited optimality certificates** for the exact branch-price-and-cut component. The certificates issued by earlier versions did not survive scrutiny; this release repairs the underlying defects, hardens the certification protocol, and re-establishes the certified best-known-solution store from scratch under it.

### Fixed (soundness)

- **Pricing-ladder termination.** The escalation over pricing levels (heuristic cost, heuristic elementarity, exact) could close a node without ever running the exact level, so a certificate could be issued with zero exact-pricing iterations. Escalation is now driven by the number of columns actually added, not by an empty pool. This was the decisive defect; it invalidated every certificate produced since the checker-exact-column change and forced a full re-certification.
- **Uninitialized labeling-mode flag.** The bidirectional labeling's symmetric-mode flag was never initialized (the vendoring dropped the upstream wiring), reading per-build stack garbage. This is the mechanism behind the build-dependent certification observed during the campaign. The flag is now explicit and the mode is a controlled experimental arm.
- **Set-valued duration at departure-choice plateaus.** On stepwise arrival-time functions a plateau makes the departure at a given arrival a set, so a partial path's duration is the minimum over that set; two sites priced an arbitrary representative instead of the minimum, surfacing as material four-way disagreements. Fixed with an explicit minimum over the covering pieces (`PWLFunction::MinValueAt`).
- **Checker-infeasible priced columns no longer crash a solve.** A column the reference checker rejects now poisons that run and is skipped (poison-and-continue), and a poisoned run can never support a certificate, instead of aborting the whole solve.
- **Hole-tolerant composition** on interior domain gaps of post-domination duration functions (previously crashed on some stepwise instances once the exact level ran).

### Added

- **Tagged verticals** in the PWL engine (JUMP vs CHOICE) with exact graph reflections (`FlipTime`/`FlipValue`) replacing the fragile mollifier composition on the reflected paths; the acceptance gate for the symmetric merge on stepwise data now passes.
- **Multi-gate certification protocol** and its offline analyzer: four solves per instance (cold and warm starts crossed with the two labeling modes), value agreement at one checker-exact value not above the store, an audited exact-pricing census, a pricing-integrity guard, cross-platform agreement on stepwise families, and a direction-aware exact-arm witness.
- **Randomized differential fuzzer** and a per-label trace harness used to find and pin the defects above (`tests/td_fuzz.py`, `tests/test_prover_fuzz_soundness.py`, `KAYROS_TRACE_PATH`).
- Dormant, unit-tested exact value-jump labeling scaffolding (the principled replacement for the mollifier on stepwise pricing), not yet on the default path.

### Changed

- **Optimality certificates on stepwise (value-jump) instances are refused from a single solve** and are only issued under the audited multi-run campaign protocol; the producer guard enforces this.
- The definitive re-certification (all 1352 instances of the four legacy MAMUT families, both problem types) established the store at **468 proven optima, 170 of them checker-valid strict improvements**, with zero four-way disagreements remaining and every stamp carrying audited-protocol provenance.
- Dependency floor raised: `mamut-routing-lib>=0.6.0` (needs the `OptimalityMetadata` schema; the tested stack).

### Packaging

- The vendored Lera-Romero MIT attribution (`cpp/lera/NOTICE.md`) is now carried into the wheel's `.dist-info/licenses/` alongside the root `LICENSE`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-08

- Default anytime strategy switched to `"ils"` (single-trajectory iterated local search) after a large head-to-head campaign; `Params(strategy="aco")` restores the 0.3.x solver.
- Local search of every strategy uses granular candidate lists (`num_neighbours=50`) by default; `Params(num_neighbours=0)` restores exhaustive enumeration.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-07

- Exact branch-price-and-cut component (`kayros.lera`) ships in the default build on the open-source HiGHS LP backend (the CPLEX backend stays a source-build opt-in). Checker-exact column costs and honest time-limit gap reporting.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-06

- Anytime heuristic solver (`kayros.solve`): greedy construction, MAX-MIN TD ant colony, and the time-dependent granular local search over the NDCPWLF engine; streaming incumbents under a hard deadline.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-06

- Initial public release: the NDCPWLF composition engine, a bit-identical C++ port of the reference checker's arithmetic, gated by an equivalence suite over the full benchmark set.
